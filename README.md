# React Interview Round Practical Session

This repository is designed to prepare for practical React.js interview rounds. It includes hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios that test essential React skills required for a senior developer role.

## Install the below dependency

```sh
npm i primereact primeicons primeflex uuid react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query --save
```

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to help developers prepare for React interview sessions by working on practical coding challenges. It covers various concepts such as state management, component lifecycle, hooks, performance optimization, and more.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Component Architecture**: Understanding of functional and class components, reusability, and best practices.
- **React Hooks**: Usage of useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks.
- **State Management**: Lifting state up, prop drilling, and integrating external state management libraries like Redux.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data using `fetch` or `Axios`, handling loading states, and working with RESTful APIs.
- **Routing**: Implementing routing using React Router, dynamic routing, and protected routes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
- **Form Handling**: Controlled and uncontrolled forms, validation, and form libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to simulate a real-world coding environment, with each folder representing a distinct interview scenario:

1. **Basic Component**: Implement a simple component with basic state and props.
2. **API Call Integration**: Build a component that fetches data from an API and displays it.
3. **State Management**: Set up a complex state using `useReducer` or Redux.
4. **Routing Implementation**: Add routing to navigate between different components.
5. **Optimization**: Identify performance bottlenecks and apply optimizations.
6. **Testing**: Write tests for your components and state logic.
